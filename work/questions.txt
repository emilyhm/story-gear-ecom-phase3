Q U E S T I O N S 

CLIENT 


SERVER
- how should i structure my tests?
    - tests should be based on things that are fixed, not things that you are still working on the details.
- should i use path and express urlencoded?
    - middleware is needed to be able to read req.body and interprets it urlencoded is for the language so that it knows 
    - path is used to show the absolute path to your file, also connected with the question below  
        - how does the app.get * work?
            - just copy it, it will be the same for everyone

- how are the pages going to be linked? as long as the functionality is there, does it have to look as 'styled' as it does currently with the JSON file?
    - yes, use the filter and it should fire off an api request, it goes through the server, is taken from the database, and is sent back all the way to the react app 

- use the params property - fetch how do you submit a query with it? look it up 

- week 11 and 12 for patterns to look at
